# Computer Graphic - Midterm
Computer Graphic Midterm - Indra Imanuel Gunawan / 20195118

This is my code implementation for the Computer Graphic Midterm.
In this code, I implemented curve drawing using :
1. Lagrange
2. Bezier
3. Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolation
4. Cubic Spline Interpolation

The code is implemented in python, with the help of pygame library
